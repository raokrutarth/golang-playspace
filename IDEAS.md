# Ideas

Ideas to try build with the sample app. Each should pose a new design challenge.

- render/serve/query a poorly served dataset
  - real-estate
    - trees per city ranking.
  - stock analysis
  - warehouse/shipping data
  - gov report data
  - people correctness scores.
- anonymous pool message board.
  - might need research for a secure solution.
  - needs to forget client connection identifiers like IP.
  - no identities/usernames. RO content board.
- timer file share app.
