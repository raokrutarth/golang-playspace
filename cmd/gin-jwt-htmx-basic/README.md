Creating a web application using Golang, HTMX. Use JWT for authentication, PostgreSQL for data storage, and GORM for CRUD operations. Use PostgreSQL database and create a table to store user information (e.g., username, password hash). Configure GORM to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Define a struct that represents the user model and set up CRUD operations using GORM. Implement JWT token generation and verification functions in Go. Securely store JWT secret key and use it to sign and verify tokens. Create an HTML login form that sends user credentials to the backend. Handle form submission in Go, validate user credentials, generate JWT token upon successful authentication. Use HTMX to make AJAX requests to the backend for login/authentication without page reloads. Update the DOM dynamically based on the response from the server. Create middleware in Go to verify JWT tokens for protected routes. Restrict access to certain endpoints based on the presence and validity of JWT tokens. Hash user passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt before storing them in the database.

## TODO

- try out slow lazy loading htmx trick: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0KLalTM4M>
